# Minimal Blog
This template is inspired from a [dribbble post](https://dribbble.com/shots/23563106--blog) by [Nicolas Solerieu](https://dribbble.com/SLRNCL). This is a small blog template that is solely focused on writing blogs from your text editor(like a real developer).

The template is completely based on HTML and CSS. No boilerplate, no JS, no tailwind, no plugins. Just a sublime blogging experience.

I'm working on this template, so I'll see some breaking changes sometimes! ;)

## Features
- [x] blog routing
- [x] rss feed `/rss.xml`

## TO ADD
