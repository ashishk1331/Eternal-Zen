			Hey, I'm Ashish Khare, an design engineer intern at <a href="https://frontendhire.com/">Frontend-Hire</a>. I enjoy making cool-looking websites. I love playing with design and figuring out how to make things user-friendly. Sure, I'm just starting out, but I'm all about creating slick interfaces and clean code. Take a look at my work and let me know what you think. Catch you later!
